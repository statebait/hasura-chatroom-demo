# Hasura Chatroom Demo

A Chatroom Web App built with React and Hasura.

## Tutorial

> The `master` branch contains the working code of the demo

### Configuring Hasura & the Database

- To follow the tutorial you will need the tutorial branch of the repository; clone the repository like this:

  ```bash
  git clone --single-branch --branch tutorial https://github.com/statebait/hasura-chatroom-demo.git
  ```

- Next you need to start the docker containers for the PostgreSQL database and Hasura GraphQL Engine. Run the following for that inside the repo:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- This will spin up both the containers and now the Hasura console should be avalaible at:

  ```
  http://localhost:8080/console
  ```

  If for some reason nothing appears, try running the docker command again.

- Get familiar with the console ðŸ˜ƒ. Navigate to the "DATA" tab and here we will create all the tables we need for the Chatroom Web App.

- Go ahead and click on 'Create Table' next to the Schema heading.

- The first table we will be creating is the users table. Name the table 'users', add a column called username with column_type as Text. Add this column as the primary key. Finally click "Add Table" below.

  ```
  table_name: users
  Columns:
  column_name: username (Primary Key)
  column_type: Text
  ```

- Next we need a table for chatrooms. So create this:

  ```
  table_name: chatrooms
  Columns:
  #1
  column_name: id (Primary Key)
  column_type: Integer Auto-Increment
  #2
  column_name: name (Unique)
  column_type: Text
  ```

- Finally we need to create a table for the messages, here we'll need to add 2 Foreign Keys for the chatroom and user.

  Create this:

  ```
  table_name: messages
  Columns:
  #1
  column_name: id (Primary Key)
  column_type: Integer Auto-Increment
  #2
  column_name: text
  column_type: Text
  #3
  column_name: chatroom_id (Foreign Key)
  column_type: Integer
  #4
  column_name: user (Foreign Key)
  column_type: Text
  ```

Now navigate below to the Foreign Key section and add the first foreign key from the table chatrooms:

```
messages.chatroom_id -> chatrooms.id
```

And not the second foreign key from the table users:

```
messages.user -> users.username
```

Great! Now you are done with adding the tables!

- Go ahead and click on the chatrooms table and go to the 'Insert Rows' tab. Here add one chatroom with any name you like. (You can add multiple too ðŸ˜‡).

- Now go to the "GRAPHIQL" tab. This is a GraphQL playground where you can play and test different queries before adding them to your Apps. In this demo we will deal with all the 3 types of queries available in GraphQL - Query, Mutation, Subscription.

- In the 'Explorer' (If you can't see there should be a button to named 'Explorer' to open it up) you will see a bunch of queries already there which you can just click on and add. In the bottom part of the Explorer you can add (switch) to Mutations/Subscriptions.

### Building the Web App

The React app consist of three views:

- Login
- Chatroom List
- Chatroom

The tutorial branch has all the code for the working demo except all the GraphQL related logic, which is the main focus of this tutorial.

So lets begin!

#### Login View

The login view has a simple input box where one can enter their name; on entering the name a mutation to create a user is made in the database, the 'USER' key is added to localStorage for future use and finally the user is navigated to the chatrooms view.

Imports:

```jsx
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { useMutation } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
```

Queries:

```jsx
const ADD_USER = gql`
  mutation addUser($user: String) {
    insert_users(objects: { username: $user }) {
      affected_rows
    }
  }
`;
```

Hook:

```jsx
const [addUser, { error }] = useMutation(ADD_USER);

if (error) {
  return <div>Something went wrong...Please refresh the page.</div>;
}
```

Usage:

```jsx
addUser({
  variables: {
    user: value,
  },
})
  .then((data) => {
    window.localStorage.setItem("USER", value);
    handleLogin();
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

#### Chatroom List View

Imports:

```jsx
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
```

Queries:

```jsx
const GET_CHATROOMS = gql`
  {
    chatrooms {
      name
      id
    }
  }
`;
```

Hook:

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_CHATROOMS);
if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
else if (error) return <div>Something went wrong</div>;
```

#### Chatroom view

Imports:

```jsx
import { useSubscription, useMutation } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
```

Queries:

```jsx
const MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION = gql`
  subscription messageSubscription($chatroomId: Int!) {
    messages(where: { chatroom_id: { _eq: $chatroomId } }) {
      id
      text
      user
    }
  }
`;

const SEND_MESSAGE = gql`
  mutation sendMessage($chatroomId: Int, $text: String, $user: String) {
    insert_messages(
      objects: { chatroom_id: $chatroomId, text: $text, user: $user }
    ) {
      affected_rows
    }
  }
`;
```

Hook:

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useSubscription(MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION, {
  variables: {
    chatroomId,
  },
});
const [sendMessage] = useMutation(SEND_MESSAGE);
```

Usage:

```jsx
sendMessage({
  variables: { chatroomId, text: currentMessage, user },
});
setCurrentMessage("");
```
